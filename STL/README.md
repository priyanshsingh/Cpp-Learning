# Standard Template Library (STL)

The Standard Template Library(STL) is a set of C++ template classes to provide common programming data structures and functions such as lists, stacks, arrays etc.

- It is a library of container classes, algorithms, and iterators.
- It is a gemeralised library and so, its components are parameterised.
- A working knowledge of template classes is a prerequisite for the working with STL.

## STL has 4 components

1. Algorithms
2. Containers
3. Functions
4. Iterators
