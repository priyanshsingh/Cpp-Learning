// Sonali joined a social networking site to stay in touch with her friends. The signup page required her to input a name and a password.
// However, the password must be strong. The website considers a password to be strong if it satisfies the following criteria:

// Its length is at least 6.

// It contains at least one digit.

// It contains at least one lowercase English character.

// It contains at least one uppercase English character.

// It contains at least one special character. The special characters are: !@#$%^&*()-+

// She typed a random string of length n in the password field but wasnt sure if it was strong.
// Given the string she typed, can you find the minimum number of characters she must add to make her password strong?
